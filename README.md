Rewriting http://unicodinator.com from the ground up with modern goodies!

I wrote Unicodinator in 2011 but I haven't done much with it since 2012.  I am thinking of rewriting it using:

* React
* ES6
* flexbox?
* updated browser support
* supporting characters beyond the BMP (maybe)
* support for per-character real URLS (not just hash)

Lets see how far I get...
